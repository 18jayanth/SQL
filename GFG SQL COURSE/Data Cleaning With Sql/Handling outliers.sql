Handling Outliers
Outliers are data points that deviate significantly from other observations in a dataset. They can skew analyses and lead to inaccurate insights. Identifying and handling outliers is crucial for maintaining the integrity of your data. Lets explore how to handle outliers using SQL with an example dataset, messy_indian_dataset.

Finding Outliers Based on Z-Score
A Z-score measures how many standard deviations an element is from the mean. Values with a Z-score greater than 3 or less than -3 are often considered outliers. Heres how to calculate the Z-score for the purchase_amount column:

SELECT *, 
       ABS(purchase_amount - AVG(purchase_amount) OVER()) / STDDEV(purchase_amount) OVER() AS 'z_score'
FROM messy_indian_dataset;
Output:
id	name	age	gender	email	phone_number	city	state	purchase_amount	purchase_date	z_score
1	Rajesh Patel	30	Male	rajesh@example.com	9876543210	Mumbai	Maharashtra	1000.50	2023-01-05	0.560
2	Priya Sharma	25	Female	priya@example.com	9876543211	Delhi	Delhi	5000.00	2023-02-15	1.204
3	Amit Kumar	35	Male	amit@example.com	9876543212	Bangalore	Karnataka	750.25	2023-03-25	0.683
4	Ritu Singh	28	Female	ritu@example.com	9876543213	Kolkata	West Bengal	1200.75	2023-04-10	0.460
5	Ankit Tiwari	32	Male	ankit@example.com	9876543214	Lucknow	Uttar Pradesh	900.00	2023-05-20	0.635
6	Swati Gupta	27	Female	swati@example.com	9876543215	Jaipur	Rajasthan	1500.00	2023-06-05	0.349
7	Nina Rao	40	Female	nina@example.com	9876543216	Chennai	Tamil Nadu	8000.00	2023-07-15	2.345
8	Vijay Sharma	45	Male	vijay@example.com	9876543217	Pune	Maharashtra	2000.00	2023-08-25	0.163
9	Meera Das	29	Female	meera@example.com	9876543218	Hyderabad	Telangana	3000.00	2023-09-10	0.530

Removing Outliers Based on Specific Z-Score
To remove outliers, we can filter the dataset to keep only rows with a Z-score less than 3.

Output:
SELECT * FROM
(
    SELECT *, 
           ABS(purchase_amount - AVG(purchase_amount) OVER()) / STDDEV(purchase_amount) OVER() AS 'z_score'
    FROM messy_indian_dataset
) AS sub_table 
WHERE sub_table.z_score < 3;
id	name	age	gender	email	phone_number	city	state	purchase_amount	purchase_date
1	Rajesh Patel	30	Male	rajesh@example.com	9876543210	Mumbai	Maharashtra	1000.50	2023-01-05
2	Priya Sharma	25	Female	priya@example.com	9876543211	Delhi	Delhi	5000.00	2023-02-15
3	Amit Kumar	35	Male	amit@example.com	9876543212	Bangalore	Karnataka	750.25	2023-03-25
4	Ritu Singh	28	Female	ritu@example.com	9876543213	Kolkata	West Bengal	1200.75	2023-04-10
5	Ankit Tiwari	32	Male	ankit@example.com	9876543214	Lucknow	Uttar Pradesh	900.00	2023-05-20
6	Swati Gupta	27	Female	swati@example.com	9876543215	Jaipur	Rajasthan	1500.00	2023-06-05
8	Vijay Sharma	45	Male	vijay@example.com	9876543217	Pune	Maharashtra	2000.00	2023-08-25
9	Meera Das	29	Female	meera@example.com	9876543218	Hyderabad	Telangana	3000.00	2023-09-10
Conclusion
Handling outliers in SQL involves identifying and possibly removing data points that are significantly different from the rest of the dataset. By using techniques such as Z-scores, we can systematically detect and manage outliers, ensuring that our data analyses are robust and reliable.
