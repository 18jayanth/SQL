Example Queries and Their Execution Steps
Lets delve into several SQL queries and break down the execution steps for each.

Query 1: Simple SELECT Statement
SELECT name, city
FROM messy_indian_dataset;
Execution Steps:
FROM Clause: Identifies the source table (messy_indian_dataset) from which data will be retrieved.
SELECT Clause: Specifies the columns (name and city) to include in the result set.
Query 2: SELECT with WHERE Clause
SELECT name, city, purchase_amount
FROM messy_indian_dataset
WHERE purchase_amount > 1000;
Execution Steps:
FROM Clause: Identifies the source table (messy_indian_dataset).
WHERE Clause: Filters rows where purchase_amount is greater than 1000.
SELECT Clause: Specifies the columns (name, city, purchase_amount) to include in the result set.
Query 3: SELECT with WHERE and ORDER BY Clauses
SELECT name, city, purchase_amount
FROM messy_indian_dataset
WHERE purchase_amount > 1000
ORDER BY purchase_amount DESC;
Execution Steps:
FROM Clause: Identifies the source table (messy_indian_dataset).
WHERE Clause: Filters rows where purchase_amount is greater than 1000.
ORDER BY Clause: Sorts the result set based on purchase_amount in descending order.
SELECT Clause: Specifies the columns (name, city, purchase_amount) to include in the result set.
Query 4: SELECT with GROUP BY Clause
SELECT city, AVG(purchase_amount) AS avg_purchase
FROM messy_indian_dataset
GROUP BY city;
Execution Steps:
FROM Clause: Identifies the source table (messy_indian_dataset).
GROUP BY Clause: Groups rows by the city column.
SELECT Clause: Computes the average purchase_amount for each city and includes city and avg_purchase in the result set.
Query 5: SELECT with GROUP BY and HAVING Clauses
SELECT city, AVG(purchase_amount) AS avg_purchase
FROM messy_indian_dataset
GROUP BY city
HAVING AVG(purchase_amount) > 1000;
Execution Steps:
FROM Clause: Identifies the source table (messy_indian_dataset).
GROUP BY Clause: Groups rows by the city column.
HAVING Clause: Filters groups where the average purchase_amount is greater than 1000.
SELECT Clause: Computes the average purchase_amount for each city and includes city and avg_purchase in the result set.
Query 6: SELECT with JOIN
SELECT m.name, m.city, s.region
FROM messy_indian_dataset m
JOIN states s ON m.state = s.state;
Execution Steps:
FROM Clause: Specifies the source tables (messy_indian_dataset as m and states as s) for data retrieval.
JOIN: Joins rows from messy_indian_dataset (m) with states (s) based on matching state values.
SELECT Clause: Specifies the columns (name, city from m and region from s) to include in the result set.
Query 7: Nested SELECT (Subquery)
SELECT name, city, purchase_amount
FROM messy_indian_dataset
WHERE purchase_amount > (SELECT AVG(purchase_amount) FROM messy_indian_dataset);
Execution Steps:
Subquery (FROM Clause): Executes the inner query to calculate the average purchase_amount across all records in messy_indian_dataset.
FROM Clause: Identifies the source table (messy_indian_dataset).
WHERE Clause: Filters rows where purchase_amount is greater than the average purchase_amount obtained from the subquery.
SELECT Clause: Specifies the columns (name, city, purchase_amount) to include in the result set.
Final Thoughts on Order of Execution
Understanding the order of SQL query execution is critical for writing efficient and effective queries. The sequence typically follows:

FROM: Determines the source tables and joins if any.
WHERE: Applies row filtering.
GROUP BY: Groups rows by specified columns.
HAVING: Applies group filtering.
SELECT: Determines which columns to include in the final result set.
ORDER BY: Sorts the result set.
LIMIT: Restricts the number of rows in the result set.
By mastering these execution steps, SQL developers and analysts can optimize query performance and achieve accurate results from their data.
