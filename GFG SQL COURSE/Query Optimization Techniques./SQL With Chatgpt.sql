Practical Examples with ChatGPT
Lets see how ChatGPT can assist with real-world SQL scenarios:

User Query:
User: How can I find the total sales per month for the past year from the 'sales' table?
ChatGPT: You can use a query like:
SELECT MONTH(sale_date) AS month, YEAR(sale_date) AS year, SUM(sale_amount) AS total_sales
FROM sales
WHERE sale_date >= DATE_SUB(CURDATE(), INTERVAL 1 YEAR)
GROUP BY YEAR(sale_date), MONTH(sale_date);
Optimization Advice:
User: My query to find top customers by total purchases is slow. Any suggestions?
ChatGPT: Consider using pre-aggregation in a CTE to improve performance:
WITH PreAggregated AS (
    SELECT customer_id, SUM(purchase_amount) AS total_spent
    FROM purchases
    GROUP BY customer_id
)
SELECT c.name, pa.total_spent
FROM customers c
JOIN PreAggregated pa ON c.customer_id = pa.customer_id
ORDER BY pa.total_spent DESC
LIMIT 10;
